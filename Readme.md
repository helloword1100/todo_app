I have made this project using laravel some of the things to setup this project are:
1) make a data base with the name todolist
2) run the command php artisan migrate:fresh to migrate all the tables
3) then run php artisan serve to run this project

   I have made this project using laravel breeze for authentication and controllers for controlling the crud operations for my todo app , i have also attached a demo video with this project
